Before FAT:
    Test, test, test
    Make sure Ewa uses BEAM-4.10-SNAPSHOT and gets all required Case2R files.
    ATD: incl L2 proc. description., describe MA input format,

After FAT:
    IMPORTANT: Include in MA input product set, minDate, maxDate, region in report, need to cite in-situ dataset (!!!)
    IMPORTANT: All productions: users need to provide output name (= also used as job name & staging file name).
    IMPORTANT: Add Restart
    IMPORTANT: Production Request Template Management
    IMPORTANT: Logout
    IMPORTANT: Add function to show detailed error messages (e.g. logs) for failed productions!!!
    IMPORTANT: FTP and inform users about production status via e-mail
    IMPORTANT: Add SUM/Help
    IMPORTANT: We need to address the situation where we can't retrieve status of jobs from Haddoop.
               We then can't determine if a production is complete and so it will remain in RUNNING state forever.
               1. Every production must have a unique output dir (also L3/TA where we create mult. output dirs per workflow item)
               2. Every Hadoop job writes a "done" status file (e.g. <job-id>-done.txt) into the output dir
               3. If a production finds all "done" status files, the production is complete, regardless of the Hadoop job statuses
               3. Replace ProcessStatus.UNKNOWN by ORDERED (just created but no status yet received) and LOST (meaning no more info from Hadoop)

    Check request: Say that it is valid, before showing request params.
    Add metadata to L3 products
    Recognize prod. param. "autoDelete" (output params) or hide from UI
    All production outputs: Provide production statistics XML, e.g. total time, #tasks, #bytes, #input/output records, hadoop counters,
                            provide WPS XML
    Add regions to HSQL database
    Processor form: changes in the parameters field shall be kept instead of being overwritten, if proc. sel. changes
    New productions shall appear first in Manage Productions table
