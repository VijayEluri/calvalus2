1) Production Management:
- A search mask after processing (L2, MA, ...), after staging status, after downloaded / not downloaded
- An info if production has already been downloaded
- SELECT ALL checkbox.

2) A possibility to create one or more requests ( e.g. L3 Processing, some MA, some TA.... ) and to start all jobs later, e.g. at night.
